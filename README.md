# AIRCRAFT FATALITY ANALYSIS

 # **BUSINESS PROBLEM**
 Your company is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### **Overview of Business Understanding**
This project aims  to solve  potential risks in the aircraft business. The company aims at reducing risk and uncertainty in the company as the company aims at expanding the business. Since the company has no prior experience in the potential risk of aircraft, the business aims at coming up with the lowest risk aircraft that are safe to them and additionally profitable to the business.

### **The 3 main business questions for solving  the problem in this data will be:**
1. Which type of aircraft and model has the highest accident/fatality rates?
2. How serious are incidents by aircraft type?
3. Which aircraft has the lowest risk in terms of accidents?

The goal of this project is to help top management and relevant stakeholders like the risk department, finance, operations in the aviation industry to venture in more safer airctrafts that are less risk and more safe and that are still profitable to the business.

In conclusion, the goal of this project is to come up with safer and more profitable aircraft  as they expand in the aviation industry. The aim is to pin point aircrafts that do not pose financial risks and are of low operational risk. The findings of this project will help relevant stakeholders  in coming up with aircraft that are of low cost and low operational exposure. It will enable them to be safer, more strategic in the aviation industry. 

 # **DATA UNDERSTANDING**
The data source for this project is Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandkushawaha/aviation-crashed-flights-data?resource=download. This data is suitable for this project because it identifies the problems encountered in the aircraft business, specifically in terms of operational and financial risk that is actually faced by stakeholders.

# **DATA CLEANING**
This project was cleaned using pandas using Jupyter Notebook and the cleaned csv file was loaded in Tableau where visuals were created

### *Key Metrics:
Total fatalities
* **Aircraft with highest fatality**
* **lowest accident risk aircraft**
* **Incidents incurred by aircrafts**

## **Finding**
The findings of this project include:

The de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300 and Cessna 208B Grand Caravan have the highest fatality rate.
Airbus Aircraft have the lowest risk
Cessna 208B Grand Caravan has the highest severe incident in terms of type of damage it causes

## **Recommendation**
Some of the recommendations I would give to the stakeholders are:
1. Avoid investing money into the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300 and Cessna 208B Grand Carava as this will led too a hudge finacial loss because the aircraft causes a lot of accidents.
2. Invest in Airbus-type craft, the aircraft are safer for high commercial routes, which will be more reliable and less risky.
3. Not to invest in Cessna 208B Grand Caravan to minimize their financial risk and operational risks.
